# ML-foundations

I started learning Machine Learning and Statistics on my own a few months ago, and am using this repo as a way of organizing the code that results from this endeavor.

If you stumble upon this and are reading to learn / to critique / out of curiosity, reach out! I am in no way an expert, and could really use some chatting about these concepts!

I do not claim any of these are correct or optimal, nor do I claim I own the related problem sets and homework assignments.
