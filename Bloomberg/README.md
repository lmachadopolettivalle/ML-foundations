# My homework solutions for Bloomberg's "Foundations of Machine Learning" course

The course material was made available [here](https://bloomberg.github.io/foml/#home), and this is nothing more, nothing less than my personal attempt to solve the homework projects that follow the lectures.

# Licensing
This is my personal repo where I try to solve some homework problems. I intentionally did not upload the .pdf files and associated with these homework problems - please find them in the course website.
If you have any thoughts on using this material publicly, please reach out to the owners of these materials -- not me, but the instructors of Bloomberg's official course.
